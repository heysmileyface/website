### Features

Here are a few interesting features of this Jekyll theme:

- A fully customizable and empty `_BLANK_config.yml` to make getting up-and-running easy.
- A speedy, on-site search function using [Simply Jekyll Search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search).
- Custom collections for different types of material (note-taking, journal writing, etc.)
- An auto-generating archive page that displays all entries from _all_ collections.
- Having a `_pages` collection for easier organization.
- An author bio at the end of each post. (Located in `_inclues/author.html`)
- Full Rouge support for syntax highlighting. (Currently using `base16.solarized.light`)
- Auto-generated RSS feed, sitemap, accessibility features, and search-engine optimization.
