wouldnt limiting russias access to information on the hurt that they are causing globally on media such as facebook, instagram, twitter and other sites, increase the power of the government to send its people into ukraine. by limiting the poeple of russia access to information outside of russia, russian citizens are forced to listen to the propaganda and one sided arguements for the invasion. without external information russian citizens may not understand the ridiculousness of the war and inturn russia will have larger troops.
