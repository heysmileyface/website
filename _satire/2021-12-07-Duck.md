Have you ever felt like your being watched? Have you ever felt the uneasiness of the pond’s gloomy waters? Underwater ducks at James Hamilton Heritage park are being held in East Kilbride Police Station for suspicious activity. For what? we do not know. Suspects have lured the pond to find no traces of evidence, all was discovered was a dead seagull. Police have issued a statement “The ducks have been arrested on suspicion to plot that instigates that they will overthrow the government and start controlling UK citizens”. The ducks of the heritage park have finally issued a statement “QUaCkKKkKKKK, QuAcK qUAcK QUaCKKkkK”. Such terrifying statements have haunted civilians in the area, Margaret Thatcher declares “I can’t go into the area anymore, they keep hissing at me. they said they would scrap my dug”. Ducks have brought so much fear into the society, the police are hopeful that the ducks haven’t swallowed all evidence in order to bring justice and a penalty for the duck’s awful current actions. Thank you this is BCB News, just kidding You have been fooled, i am duck and you will all bow down to your new Government.
