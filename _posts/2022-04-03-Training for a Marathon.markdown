### The Ultimate Goal.

I am by no means an athlete. I can barely swim 1k, i can barely cycle anymore than 7 miles and my fastest 5k is currently 21:30. My goal in life is to run an Iron man, i believe it to be one of the toughest achievements a human can do with their body. Since 1978 there have been approximately 400,000 Iron man finishers. On earth with 7.9 billion people, that means that roughly if a person has completed an Iron man they are 1/20,000 . Although id love to complete an Iron man right now, i believe their are some checkpoints to be met first.

### Training

The first of these checkpoints is completing the marathon. A marathon is 42.2km long, the longest ive ever ran is 10k. i have a long way to go as of yet and i believe that once i do complete the marathon i will become a much better person. i believe that i will be more disicplined and more mentally prepared for any problems that arrive in my life. thats the real reason why im focusing on this goal really. i want to be a more resilient person that can withstand higher amounts of stress. i believe that one of the ways of doing this is to complete these cardio goals.

Looking through [this](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/A_Comparison_of_Marathon_Training_Plans) website i have narrowed it down to 2 potential training programs:

- [Jack Daniels plan A](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Jack_Daniels#Jack_Daniels_Plan_A)

- [Jeff Galloway's You Can Do it!](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Galloway)

according to [this](https://runsmartproject.com/calculator/) calculator i should be expected to run the following times based on my best 5k of 21:30 :

| Race          | Time     | Pace/Mi | Pace/Km |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Marathon      | 03:25:21 | 07:50   | 04:52   |
| Half marathon | 01:38:49 | 07:32   | 04:41   |
| 15K           | 01:08:37 | 07:22   | 04:34   |
| 10K           | 00:44:35 | 07:10   | 04:27   |
| 5K            | 00:21:30 | 06:55   | 04:18   |
| 1Mi           | 00:06:19 | 06:19   | 03:55   |

Unsure how accurate this would be as the 10k that i completed took just under 1 hour at 58 minutes. that being said, i did not pace myself to complete this run and im thinking that if i can complete a 5k at this time then i can complete a 10k at a much faster time.

#### Jack Daniels

*see plan [here](https://www.docdroid.net/anIO8Wt/daniels-running-formula-pdf)*

The jack daniels plan consists of 2 runs a week, a speedwork and a long run. You can however run more times a week if you wish, it is recommended that for a marathon, 3-4 times a week is best.
