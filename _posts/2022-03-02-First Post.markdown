This is my first post. actually this is my second attempt at it as ive already finished this but have actually forgotten to save it.

i believe that i bought this domain around december time and ive not actually used it to host much content. i would like to get in the habit of actually using the website to host essays, or projects that i work on and eventually build a portfolio that i can look back on and be proud of.
